A well-rounded weapon that possesses decent handling, damage, and accuracy. It possesses the ability to fire in 3-round bursts, as well as a mediocre rate-of-fire and a rather low damage drop-off. That being said, it is still suitable for mid-to-long range engagements.</p>\n<p>The NV5c is a forward-ejecting Bullpup design. Forward-ejecting allows the NV5c to be a truly ambidextrous 7.62 Bullpup. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The NV5c is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62x51 mm caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18\" model to be only 26.1\" long, or as much as 14\" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The NV5c is also the safest Bullpup developed because the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threaded muzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with an A2-style Flash Hider. A Mil-Spec attachment rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work \"drop free\" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20-round magazine is included, and the NV5c comes with a two-point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities/Flaws:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DURRABLE</strong>: The item is built to last.

A well-rounded weapon that possesses decent handling, damage, and accuracy. It possesses the ability to fire in 3-round bursts, as well as a mediocre rate-of-fire and a rather low damage drop-off. That being said, it is still suitable for mid-to-long range engagements.</p>\n<p>The NV5 is a forward-ejecting Bullpup design. Forward-ejecting allows the NV5 to be a truly ambidextrous 7.62 Bullpup. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The NV5 is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62x51 mm caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18\" model to be only 26.1\" long, or as much as 14\" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The NV5 is also the safest Bullpup developed because the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threaded muzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with an A2-style Flash Hider. A Mil-Spec attachment rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work \"drop free\" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20-round magazine is included, and the NV5 comes with a two-point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities/Flaws:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AUTOMATIC</strong>: The weapon reloads and fires auto- matically so long as its trigger is depressed.
