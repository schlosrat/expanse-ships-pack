They include things like stun-guns and tasers, which use charges of electricity, or close range chemical weapons like mace or pepper spray.</p>\n<p>As a general guideline, a stunning weapon does penetrating damage (see <strong>Penetrating Damage</strong> in <strong>Chapter 5</strong>) but inflicts one die less damage than a comparable lethal weapon, so tasers do 1d6 damage versus a pistol&rsquo;s 2d6, for example. A target taken out by the damage from a stunning weapon cannot have the dying condition applied to them, since such weapons aren&rsquo;t lethal.
