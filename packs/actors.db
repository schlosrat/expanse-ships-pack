She is single with no family. Her parents and younger sister were killed when a rogue asteroid struck the transport they were traveling on 14 years ago. Anna was away at college at the time.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 3\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>She was last seen leaving her station in the Nauvoo Project o\u000fces three months ago at 5:24 PM (Tycho Station time). She was a bit of a loner and tended to keep to herself. She is known to be a devout Mormon and attends services regularly, though she rarely attends social activities.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 4\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div title=\"Page 4\">She had recently expressed some dissatisfaction and boredom in her work as the project neared completion. She has also had some friction with co-workers. About two months before she disappeared, she mentioned to one of her co-workers that she had received an interesting job offer for a lot more money. She claimed to have turned it down because she didn&rsquo;t want to lose her spot on the Nauvoo.</div>\n<div title=\"Page 4\">\n<div title=\"Page 12\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Having undergone the procedure more recently, Dr. Bragenholm is a little more level-headed (she does not join the mob-like attack) and tries to conceal the e\u000fect. Then she attempts to sabotage the rescue attempt at the earliest opportunity. She might grab a fallen security guard&rsquo;s gun and attempt to shoot Dr. Cerri or even trigger the self-destruct sequence for the station. The only way to get her off the ship is to render her unconscious and carry her. Anyone interacting with her can attempt a TN 11 Perception (Empathy or Intuition) test to realize that she isn&rsquo;t behaving normally.

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"8","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ZT73bonWt6UfLl6E"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"VyvpmokwDJjvBbFA","name":"Unarmed","type":"weapon","data":{"useAbl":"fight","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"dmgType":"wound","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":1,"diceType":"3","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","minStr":"0","useFocus":"Brawling","weight":0,"cost":"0","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"","itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}},"reload":"noAction","capacity":null,"range":2,"rangeMax":null,"rof":"none"},"sort":800000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.zdODwYMaR981I6aa"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/fist.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"tcSUDILiWLgTX1Ov","name":"Improvisation","type":"talent","data":{"shortDesc":"Novice","longDesc":"<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"8","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ZT73bonWt6UfLl6E"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"VyvpmokwDJjvBbFA","name":"Unarmed","type":"weapon","data":{"useAbl":"fight","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"dmgType":"wound","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":1,"diceType":"3","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","minStr":"0","useFocus":"Brawling","weight":0,"cost":"0","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"","itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}},"reload":"noAction","capacity":null,"range":2,"rangeMax":null,"rof":"none"},"sort":800000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.zdODwYMaR981I6aa"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/fist.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"5glW0SKDLIAn5Zka","name":"Carousing","type":"talent","data":{"shortDesc":"Novice","longDesc":"<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;

They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range. This is countered by firing them in numbers to overwhelm the PDCs on an enemy ship.</p>\n<p>As is seen with the Canterbury's destruction, missiles can have the side-effect of turning the \"splashed\" ship into a destructive field of moving debris, posing a further threat to any other ship in the immediate area. For this reason, the use of missiles in CQB is avoided.</p>\n<p>Being the standard armament on combat vessels, even ships small enough to not be fitted with rail guns can carry missiles. Frigates, corvettes, and patrol boats have one or two firing tubes. Larger ships like cruisers, battleships, and dreadnoughts carry between 3 and 10 tubes.</p>\n<p>Torpedoes follow the direction of shipboard targeting lasers used to &ldquo;paint&rdquo; an enemy, switching over to their own internal guidance systems when necessary. A primary function of point defense cannons is to shoot down incoming torpedoes before they can reach the ship, with electronic warfare countermeasures looking to confuse and throw off their guidance systems so a capable pilot can evade them.</p>\n<p>The ship must be at least Medium-sized to mount a single torpedo launcher. Each additional Size category doubles the capacity for torpedo launchers (two at Large, four at Huge, and so on).</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"4d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.zTfsTKi22v0NiCnA"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}

After your mother died, you and your dad kind of drifted apart, and you became more and more involved with Belter political causes, which led you to the Outer Planets Alliance.

That meant the end of higher education and finishing pre-med for you, and you and your father haven&rsquo;t spoken since he bailed you out.

{"_id":"LCwM8wR7eGwfXqc3","name":"UNN Truman-Class Dreadnought","permission":{"default":0,"wypGoDpbSltPFEBU":3},"type":"spaceship","data":{"size":"6","hull":{"nrDice":1,"diceType":6,"extraValue":0},"drive":"","description":"<p>The Truman-class dreadnought is the second largest battleship class in the United Nations Navy (UNN) that primarily serves as a flagship of UNN battlegroups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Standing at only 376 meters in length and not as sleek nor as sophisticated as her Martian counterpart (the Donnager-class), the Truman-class makes up for its lost advantage in numerous manners. Famed for its sturdiness, and reliability, it is one of the longest-serving vessels in the history of the UNN, having protected Earth's interests across the system for decades.</p>\n<p>The Truman-class dreadnought is armed with 2 Farren-Pattern high-yield heavy railgun turrets, each armed with a pair of adjustable Farren-Pattern high-yield heavy railguns that are able to inflict lethal damage over vast distances and are some of the most powerful and accurate weapons systems available to the UNN. Matched only by the highly advanced MCRN railguns and the UNN Orbital Railgun Platforms, the Truman's railguns are able to strike a target almost instantaneously when fired from within 1000 kilometers, launching an unguided tungsten projectile that will effortlessly perforate the full mass of the targeted craft, tearing through multiple decks and often striking a critical subsystem to neutralize the target vessel in a single shot. These weapons are supported by 42 Redfield Ballistics 40 mm Point Defense Cannons (PDC), spread across the surface of the dreadnought for maximum defensive coverage, as well as 9 autoloading torpedo bays compatible with a variety of warheads. The effective targeting range of the Truman-class is shorter than that of most MCRN warships but its extensive PDC grid enables it to endure even the largest torpedo volleys, protecting the ship from harm while coordinating fleet movements or bringing her railguns to bear. Unlike the style of Martian warships, the PDCs of the Truman-class dreadnoughts don't seem to be retractable in the vessel's hull itself. This would make its PDCs have more reaction time in some situations, however it does put its PDCs at risk of impact damage.</p>\n<p>A pair of hangar bays and accompanying external docking clamps are located in the midsection of the Truman-class, where its complement of 6 L-Type UNN dropship skiffs, as well as a smaller number of short-range repair skiffs and reconnaissance drones are housed. Though the Truman-class is not quite large enough to carry corvettes in its internal hangars like the MCRN Donnager-class battleships, its embarked dropships widen its mission profile to include Marine deployment and surface reconnaissance.</p>\n<p>The class shows its age in several ways, such as naked pipes and wires above corridors and constant electrical issues. The circular CIC of the class is however perhaps the most notable example of the ships age, as it makes use of computers operated with keyboards, switches and sticks rather than touchscreens and holographic interfaces as seen aboard MCRN ships and other more modern ships. However, many may have been upgraded to include touchscreen and holographic interfaces as such with the UNN Thomas Prince.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one of its most valuable traits, its versatility, an attribute that has stood the test of time, surely is the \"crown jewel\" of the ship. Few vessels are able to serve as both a battleship and a troop transport without sacrificing effectiveness in both areas, but the streamlined design of the Truman-class allows the vessel to carry out missions that would otherwise require a small flotilla. This high level of adaptability has earned the Truman-class its impressive reputation, and serves as an enduring reminder that technological sophistication is often no substitute for a simple and reliable design.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>\n<p>The Truman-class dreadnought contains many various facilities within for a warship this size.

It was protecting the UNN freighter Amberjack on a UN-MCR supply route when it was attacked by pirates. The Tynan knocked out the pirate ship and captured one of its crew in a vac suit.</p>\n<p>This ship assisted in the boarding of Marco Inaros's personal ship by firing PDC rounds at its drive cone, before a breaching pod attached to the ship. Ashford led the boarding party to capture Inaros, but they were all killed in the attack.</p>\n<p>After killing Ashford and his entire crew, Inaros had his people strip the Tynan of all its vital components including PDCs, fuel pellets, hull armor, computer panels, data cores, and comms buffers. The ship was then abandoned despite being a good hull as a message to other Belters not to defy him.</p>\n<p>After breaking off from the Outer Planets Alliance and becoming a pirate, Camina Drummer and her crews found the stripped Tynan adrift in space. Drummer had her crew fix the hull breaches and restore the ship to operational condition. Whilst this left a strain on their resources, it was successful, and the Tynan joined her small fleet, growing it to three ships. Racks of missiles were installed onto the ship in place of the missing PDCs. Camina later found Ashford's hidden stash in the airlock including a recording of him talking to Marco Inaros moments before his death.</p>\n<p>The Tynan sports MCRN markings on its hull as well as several PDC placements. It appears that the ship was not MCRN-built, but that Ashford obtained PDCs and sections of Martian hull armor and had them installed onto his ship.</p>\n<p>The ship contained 2✕ PDC until its stripping down by Marco Inaros. After Drummer obtained the ship, she had the missing PDCs replaced with missiles.</p>\n<p>The PDCs were stolen from the Martian Congressional Republic Navy with Drummer stating that they were the best in the Belt.</p>\n<p>After Drummer had the Tynan restored and refitted, its display panels still showed its original configuration with extra armor and PDC emplacements despite these having been stripped previously.</p>","passengers":[],"crew":{"min":1,"current":16,"typical":1,"competence":"1"},"weapons":{},"systems":{"maneuver":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"dex","useFocus":""},"command":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"comm","useFocus":""},"sensors":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"int","useFocus":""},"damageControl":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","TN":11,"useAbl":"int","useFocus":"","threshold":{"current":0,"target":5}}},"losses":{"normal":{"collateral":{"actual":0,"max":6},"hull":{"actual":0,"max":6},"maneuverability":{"actual":0,"max":6},"sensors":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weapons":{"actual":0,"max":6}},"serious":{"reactorOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weaponOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6}}},"takenOut":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_2eq09ppacmq"}},"img":"modules/expanse-pack/item-assets/ships/Tynan.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tynan","displayName":50,"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/Expanse_Ships/Tynan_36m_token.png","tint":"","width":4,"height":4,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"Qy5RxPBmDvijiL9U","actorLink":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"5pyrROq68OgIyICm","name":"Torpedo Tube - Light","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>Configurable Light-Grade Torpedo Launcher</strong></p>\n<p>Able to launch light grade torpedos (4d6 Conventional HE or 3d6&nbsp;Plasma or Flechette)</p>\n<p>A missile is a powerful self-propelled weapon with an explosive warhead designed to detonate either on contact with its target or in proximity to it. Missiles are the standard primary armament on all warships.</p>\n<p>They are also referred to as \"torpedoes\" when used in ship-to-ship combat, or \"nukes\" when equipped with a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p>Missiles are long-range, guided missile delivery systems that can be fitted with conventional explosives, plasma warheads (which melt armor and damage systems), flechette warheads (which penetrate ship armor better than an HE warhead, but not as well as a plasma warhead, and don more widespead systemic damage) or varying-yield nuclear warheads. They are jettisoned from the launcher, align themselves with the target, and then begin accelerating to high speed. They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range. This is countered by firing them in numbers to overwhelm the PDCs on an enemy ship.</p>\n<p>As is seen with the Canterbury's destruction, missiles can have the side-effect of turning the \"splashed\" ship into a destructive field of moving debris, posing a further threat to any other ship in the immediate area. For this reason, the use of missiles in CQB is avoided.</p>\n<p>Being the standard armament on combat vessels, even ships small enough to not be fitted with rail guns can carry missiles. Frigates, corvettes, and patrol boats have one or two firing tubes.

He was stationed at Hecate Base on Olympus Mons and also served aboard ships, including the MCRN Bandon. During this time, Alex met and married his wife Talissa, although<br />the two of them later divorced when it became clear that Alex was &ldquo;married&rdquo; first and foremost to being a pilot.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Alex&rsquo;s retirement from the Martian Navy didn&rsquo;t go well. He was restive and unhappy when no longer at the helm of a ship. He became a freighter pilot, eventually working for Pur&rsquo;n&rsquo;Kleen aboard the Cantebury. Alex was the pilot chosen to fly the Knight, the ship&rsquo;s shuttle, over to investigate the Scopuli and its distress signal. Later, when the survivors of the Knight fled the doomed Martian battleship Donnager, Alex was tasked with piloting the corvette-class frigate Tachi, as he was the most qualified surviving pilot among the escapees.</p>\n<p>Alex quickly settled into the prospect of full-time pilot of the renamed Rocinante, joining its crew on a permanent basis. Although Jim Holden is captain of the Rocinante, Alex thinks of her as &ldquo;his&rdquo; ship and frequently talks to her in his Mariner Valley Texan twang, refer- ring to the ship as &ldquo;darlin&rsquo;&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s most comfortable on board and in his acceleration couch at the helm, and not fond of leaving the ship for too long.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","age":"","background":"","socialClass":"","ancestry":"Martian","profession":"","drive":{"name":"","quality":"","downfall":""},"speed":{"base":10,"mod":0,"total":10},"defense":{"base":10,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0,"total":10},"armor":{"toughness":{"total":0,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0},"impact":0,"ballistic":0,"penalty":0},"resources":{"base":4,"mod":0},"gp":0,"sp":0,"cp":0,"currency":0,"goals":"","fear":0,"horror":{"level":0,"effect":""},"aim":{"value":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"defend":{"defenseBonus":2,"active":false,"mod":0},"guardUp":{"defenseBonus":1,"testPenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"allOutAttack":{"dmgBonus":1,"defensePenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"initiativeMod":0,"abilities":{"acc":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"comm":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cons":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"dex":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"fight":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"int":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"per":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"str":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"will":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"magic":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false}},"health":{"min":0,"value":27,"set":27},"powerPoints":{"min":0,"value":10,"set":10},"fatigue":{"min":0,"entered":0,"max":4},"conviction":{"min":0,"value":3,"set":3},"advTestThreshold":0,"conditions":{"blinded":false,"deafened":false,"exhausted":false,"fatigued":false,"freefalling":false,"helpless":false,"hindred":false,"prone":false,"restrained":false,"injured":false,"wounded":false,"unconscious":false,"dying":false}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_pim9hqk46kh"}},"img":"worlds/fortunes_favor/tokens/NPC/Alex%20Kamal.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Alex Kamal","displayName":50,"img":"tokens/Expanse-sdk5ne/Exports%20Hi/M_Alex_Stand%20copy.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":20,"brightSight":100,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"WXlvw43R38QaVbHK","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"health"},"bar2":{"attribute":"defense.total"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"czlnhIB3kqVKJKsH","name":"Expertise (Piloting- Drones)","type":"talent","data":{"shortDesc":"Novice","longDesc":"<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\"><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong>: None</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\">You are a specialist in your field.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;\"><span class=\"s2\" style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 11.5px; line-height: normal; font-kerning: none;\"><strong>NOVICE</strong>: </span><span class=\"s3\" style=\"font-kerning: none;\">Select an ability focus you have and choose a narrower task or field within it.

She&rsquo;s on track to be as close as one can get to comfortable retirement out in the Belt in about ten years, and has no desire to do anything to mess that up. Captain Reyes is well known as a &ldquo;by the book&rdquo; commanding officer who doesn&rsquo;t like surprises, so it&rsquo;s no wonder she seems tense concerning this unusual development on an otherwise routine run.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Xin Reyes had dreams once, hopes of striking it big with some mining opportunity out in the Belt. Like a lot of rock-hopper pilots, her dreams ended in considerable debt and the loss of her ship when the loan company repossessed it. She also lost touch with her crew, feeling she had failed them.</p>\n<p>Still, her skills made her a useful hire for a company like Krystal Kleer,<br />and for more than a decade and a half Reyes has settled into the routine<br />of working an ice-hauler, eventually working her way up to XO and then to<br />captain of a ship again. Even if it isn&rsquo;t her ship, per se. These days Reyes<br />is focused on the much smaller dream of keeping her job and her position<br />and eventually earning enough to retire and live out the rest of her life in relative peace, but even that seems unlikely now.</p>\n<p>Xin Reyes is a middle-aged woman of primarily Chinese and Latin heritage.

Over two meters tall and an athletic and muscular 100 kilos, Draper served in the Martian Marine Corps for some eighteen years before she and her platoon of Marines were assigned to Ganymede following the Eros incident. Monitoring UN troop movement and patrolling the surface greenhouse domes, Draper&rsquo;s platoon encountered a jamming signal and a group of UN Marines rushing their position. Initially assuming an attack, Draper quickly realized the UN troops were instead fleeing from something that turned out to be a protomolecule hybrid. The creature wiped out both the UN and Martian soldiers, and nearly finished Bobbie before it exploded, leaving her the sole survivor.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Draper later attended a meeting between Martian and UN officials on Earth to discuss the Ganymede incident, where she blurted out the existence of the protomolecule &ldquo;monster&rdquo; that attacked her platoon. Admonished by her superiors, Draper ended up meeting Chrisjen Avasarala while drinking in a bar. Avasarala offered her a job as liaison with the Martian military, which she later accepted. This decision likely saved Avasarala&rsquo;s life when Bobbie accompanied her on board Jules-Pierre Mao&rsquo;s yacht, the Guanshiyin, serving as the undersecretary&rsquo;s escort and using her military training&mdash;and Martian Goliath-Mk.III power armor&mdash;to seize control of the ship.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","age":"","background":"","socialClass":"","ancestry":"Martian","profession":"","drive":{"name":"","quality":"","downfall":""},"speed":{"base":10,"mod":0,"total":10},"defense":{"base":10,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0,"total":10},"armor":{"toughness":{"total":0,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":1},"impact":0,"ballistic":0,"penalty":0},"resources":{"base":4,"mod":0},"gp":0,"sp":0,"cp":0,"currency":0,"goals":"","fear":0,"horror":{"level":0,"effect":""},"aim":{"value":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"defend":{"defenseBonus":2,"active":false,"mod":0},"guardUp":{"defenseBonus":1,"testPenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"allOutAttack":{"dmgBonus":1,"defensePenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"initiativeMod":2,"abilities":{"acc":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"comm":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cons":{"value":4,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"dex":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"fight":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"int":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"per":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"str":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"will":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"magic":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false}},"health":{"min":0,"value":32,"set":32},"powerPoints":{"min":0,"value":10,"set":10},"fatigue":{"min":0,"entered":0,"max":4},"conviction":{"min":0,"value":3,"set":3},"advTestThreshold":0,"conditions":{"blinded":false,"deafened":false,"exhausted":false,"fatigued":false,"freefalling":false,"helpless":false,"hindred":false,"prone":false,"restrained":false,"injured":false,"wounded":false,"unconscious":false,"dying":false}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_pim9hqk46kh"}},"img":"worlds/fortunes_favor/tokens/NPC/Bobbie%20Draper.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Bobbie Draper","displayName":50,"img":"tokens/Expanse-sdk5ne/Exports%20Hi/F_Armored_Soldier_Stand%20copy.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":20,"brightSight":100,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"YSxwlENOAy3tt4BF","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"health"},"bar2":{"attribute":"defense.total"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"UWeRJLM8pZiOqjmf","name":"Unarmed (Striking Style)","type":"weapon","data":{"useAbl":"fight","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"dmgType":"wound","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":1,"diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","minStr":"0","useFocus":"Brawling","weight":0,"cost":"0","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"","itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}},"reload":"noAction","capacity":null,"range":2,"rangeMax":null,"rof":"none"},"sort":700000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.2ZNhDqXBDiZQwzV1"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/fist.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"auG9aubBd4xV16cU","name":"UNTech 9mm","type":"weapon","data":{"useAbl":"acc","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"dmgType":"wound","dmgSource":"ballistic","nrDice":2,"diceType":"6","extraValue":1,"dmgAbl":"per","minStr":"0","useFocus":"Pistols","weight":0,"cost":"11","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<p>UNMC Service service pistol.

Two and a half meters tall and weighing 400 kilograms even before a soldier climbs inside, power armor provides both a formidable offense and defense. Half armor and half spacesuit, the armor has radiation shielding sufficient to let soldiers walk through a nuclear bomb crater minutes after the blast. The armor&rsquo;s titanium and ceramic-composite exterior shielding is typically painted with camouflage patterns appropriate to the assignment, and enemies are often surprised just how well an enormous soldier in power armor can blend into the environment when they stand still.</p>\n<p>The armor&rsquo;s hydraulics system magnifies the wearer&rsquo;s strength, much like a mech rig, and carries most of the weight of the suit, allowing soldiers in power armor to undertake marathon hikes and move surprisingly fast. They also enable the armor to carry heavy weaponry, typically a rotary machine gun and sometimes a grenade launcher or micro-missile pack. Sensor packages feed data to the wearer on the helmet&rsquo;s HUD, allowing them to identify and track infrared targeting lasers used by opponents&rsquo; weapons, and even visually parse those weapons using the suit&rsquo;s camera feeds to match them against an internal database. Those same cameras monitor in all directions, sending feeds back to squad officers and their mili- tary command center, which can monitor the life signs of both the<br />soldiers and opponents who have been detected and attacked.</p>\n<p>Despite all these capabilities, power armor is still designed for maneuverability in tight spaces, enabling infantry to move in microgravity and storm their way through the narrow confines of ships. Less so is a newer addition to the Martian arsenal: 4-meter tall, 9-ton combat mechs, walking tanks carrying rail guns and missiles adapted from ship weapon systems. They are strictly for ground-assault troops, and there are few installations or opponents able to stand against them for long.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div title=\"Page 79\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If power armor loses power, it becomes massive deadweight, effectively leaving the wearer restrained and unable to use any of the armor&rsquo;s systems.</p>\n<p>Power armor requires regular maintenance activities during interludes to remain in full working order (see <strong>Interludes</strong> in <strong>Chapter 5</strong>).&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In The Expanse game terms, power armor grants the wearer the following:</p>\n<p>Qualities/Flaws:</p>\n<p><strong>ARMOR</strong>: +12 armor bonus with no armor penalty, so long as the armor is operational.</p>\n<p><strong>PHYSICAL ENHANCEMENT</strong>: +10 effective bonus to Strength and Strength(Might) tests.</p>\n<p><strong>MOBILITY ENHANCEMENT:</strong> +2 bonus to Speed and +4 bonus to Constitution (Endurance) tests.</p>\n<p><strong>WEAPONRY</strong>: An integral rifle doing 3d6 + Perception damage and capable of performing automatic weapon gun stunts.

The ship is propelled by a supercharged Destrier-4 high-velocity Epstein Drive, extensively tuned to improve acceleration, and constantly maintained by multi-injection hyper-coolant units to prevent thermal overload. Extensive measures have been taken to reduce the weight of the ship&rsquo;s hull and internal components to improve the overall thrust-to-mass ratio, allowing the ship to quickly reach extreme levels of acceleration limited only by the endurance of the human pilot.</p>\n<p>In order to best deal with pilot stresses, the operations deck has two flight seats that are fixed into large multi-axis gimbals, and equipped with numerous medical systems to monitor and mitigate the effects of acceleration stress. Ship's monitor screens wrap around the crash couches and the bulkheads, filling the pilot&rsquo;s whole visual field. The compartments behind the flight seats contain a head, food dispenser and a small bunk. The engineering deck is a sealed compartment, inaccessible from within the ship. It is accessible only to technicians while in dock. The ship has systems to recycle air and water, but not a food recycler.</p>\n<p>The pinnace can be operated by a single pilot when necessary, but generally carries an additional co-pilot to serve as the ship&rsquo;s navigator and emergency technician.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</p>","passengers":[],"crew":{"min":1,"current":2,"typical":1,"competence":"2"},"weapons":{},"systems":{"maneuver":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"dex","useFocus":""},"command":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"comm","useFocus":""},"sensors":{"mod":0,"base":1,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"int","useFocus":""},"damageControl":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","TN":11,"useAbl":"int","useFocus":"","threshold":{"current":0,"target":5}}},"losses":{"normal":{"collateral":{"actual":0,"max":6},"hull":{"actual":0,"max":6},"maneuverability":{"actual":0,"max":6},"sensors":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weapons":{"actual":0,"max":6}},"serious":{"reactorOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weaponOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6}}},"takenOut":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_2eq09ppacmq"}},"img":"modules/expanse-pack/item-assets/ships/Razorback.jpeg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Razorback","displayName":50,"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/Expanse_Ships/Razonback_20m_token.png","tint":"","width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"ZVYH7DrvlyGcKncz","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"r5mHTaK5oAOpXcRR","name":"Highly Maneuverable","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 124\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The ship is fast and maneuverable, considered one Size category smaller than its actual Size for tests to change range, to evade attacks, and for chases.

He and Naomi became romantically involved, and she became increasingly involved with Inaros&rsquo; politics. Eventually, the two of them had a son, Filip. Around that same time, Inaros used some of Naomi&rsquo;s programming work to sabotage and destroy the transport ship Augustin Gamarra out of Ceres. When Naomi learned the truth, she fell into a deep depression. Eventually, she left Inaros, who attempted to control&nbsp;her by taking custody of their infant son. Feeling she had no other choice, Naomi left them both behind.</p>\n<p>She eventually found her way to working as an engineer on board the Cantebury for the Pur&rsquo;n&rsquo;Kleen Water Company, where she was part of the crew sent to investigate the Scopuli.

However, much of this advantage is lost.</p>\n<p>Despite its small size, the Leonidas-class suffers from poor acceleration resulting from its low-quality S-250 series Epstein drives, units considered outdated even before ships of this class entered service. Low-quality targeting suites also affect the efficiency of its torpedoes and point defense cannons (PDCs) negatively, requiring more to be added to increase effective point defense and torpedo impact probability in a sort of \"spray'n'pray\" mentality. This, however, further weighed the ship down and made it even slower. The ship's poor agility mixed with its sluggish acceleration rightfully earned the class the nicknames \"Lead Leos\" or \"Brick Buckets.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike Martian PDC techniques, the 25 Mikazuki Munitions PDCs aren't able to be retracted into the battleships hull, exposing them to impact damage. However, this does give them slightly more reaction time in certain situations.</p>\n<p>In addition to these problems, its railguns cannot be adjusted while under thrust, forcing the ship to strafe an engagement zone at a drift or even coming to a relative stop once within engagement range.</p>\n<p>The ship does have some positive traits; it is practically unreachable by torpedos due to its relatively small size and high concentration of PDCs, and it is considered effective as an assault ship with its modular troop barracks and sizable M-type dropships, allowing it to carry and deploy more UN Marines than even some dedicated assault craft. However, its sluggishness makes it vulnerable to railguns, especially as its own railguns are heavily outranged by most other ships carrying them.</p>\n<p>Overall, while still a somewhat reliable warship, the slow, heavy, and poorly planned Leonidas-class stands as a symbol of the once prideful, United Nations Navy's, fall into complete stagnancy, in dire need for a drastic overhaul.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>:&nbsp;Minor Command Ship, UNMC Heavy Troop Carrier, Force Projection Vessel.</p>\n<p><strong>Utilities</strong></p>\n<p>Large Cargo Holds, Onboard UNMC Barracks, Extensive Medical Facilities, Passive and Direct Scanning systems, Fleet-grade communication system.</p>\n<p><strong>Armament</strong></p>\n<p>The Leonidas is armed with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 ✕ Dawson-Pattern Medium Railguns (Cannot be articulated under thrust)</li>\n<li>32 ✕ Single-Fire Torpedo Tubes (Conventional, Plasma, and Nuclear Warheads)</li>\n<li>25 ✕ Mikazuki Munitions Point Defense Cannons</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Craft</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>8 ✕ M-Type Dropship Skiffs</li>\n<li>Occasionally UN One (Government Shuttlecraft)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","passengers":[],"crew":{"min":1,"current":512,"typical":1,"competence":"4"},"weapons":{},"systems":{"maneuver":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"dex","useFocus":""},"command":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"comm","useFocus":""},"sensors":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"int","useFocus":""},"damageControl":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","TN":11,"useAbl":"int","useFocus":"","threshold":{"current":0,"target":5}}},"losses":{"normal":{"collateral":{"actual":0,"max":6},"hull":{"actual":0,"max":6},"maneuverability":{"actual":0,"max":6},"sensors":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weapons":{"actual":0,"max":6}},"serious":{"reactorOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weaponOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6}}},"takenOut":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_2eq09ppacmq"}},"img":"modules/expanse-pack/item-assets/ships/Leonidasclassconceptart.jpeg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Leonidas-Class Battleship","displayName":50,"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/Expanse_Ships/Escort_ship_104m_token.png","tint":"","width":6,"height":6,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"ouWXr5S8C6AMCR1e","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"KLqe0eO6By6jT4z9","name":"Torpedo Launcher 1","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p>The longest-range weapons are self-guided torpedoes, essentially a tiny Epstein Drive carrying an explosive warhead.

A ship&rsquo;s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from &ndash;2 to 6 or more, from the most minimal and broken-down sensor equipment to state-of-the-art systems found primarily in military ships.

That&rsquo;s where Amos Burton was a crime boss, running a number of illegal operations in the city&rsquo;s underworld. Those included unlicensed prostitution, which resulted in the equally unlicensed birth of a boy named Timmy, who was himself turned out as a prostitute as a child. Later, when Timmy was a physically strong teenager, he was recruited into Burton&rsquo;s syndicate by his childhood friend Erich, who worked for the organization as a hacker. Faced with the choice of killing his friend in order to prove himself, Timmy met with Burton empty-handed and killed the crime boss instead.</p>\n<p>Erich stole Amos Burton&rsquo;s identity and gave it to Timmy, along with a coveted apprenticeship on Luna and a ticket off of Earth, both to offer his thanks and at least partially to ensure that his friend would leave Baltimore for good. Adopting &ldquo;Amos Burton&rdquo; as his new name, the young man left Earth and all he knew behind. Amos learned to be a ship mechanic, and served on at least a couple other ships before finding himself on the Cantebury, working for Pur&rsquo;n&rsquo;Kleen. Always a survivor, Amos later became the chief engineer and mechanic on board the newly named Rocinante.</p>\n<p>Having experienced considerable trauma in his early years, Amos is capable of swift and savage violence without remorse as well as remarkable empathy and kindness.

There was a whole generation of Martian pioneers who worked with their hands, tackled technical challenges all day, and liked to unwind and blow off some steam when the work was done. They knew how to live. Nowadays, if you&rsquo;re good at fixing things on Mars, you&rsquo;re nothing but a glorified handyman or superintendent&mdash;or worse, tech support&mdash;and the old rough-and-tumble bars are restaurants and spas these days. So you found your way out to the new frontier, to the Belt and the Outer Planets, where the pioneer spirit of old is still alive, you&rsquo;re valued for being able to keep a bunch of tech together with nothing but spit and bailing wire, and nobody cares what you do with your off-hours.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 13\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>You&rsquo;re proof that blond hair, blue eyes, and a winning smile can get you through a lot, especially combined with a certain zest for life.

The Morrigan-class patrol destroyer is equipped with two Nariman Dynamics 40mm PDCs on its dorsal hull. A dozen of these guns are employed on the Scirocco-class assault cruiser and 60 are mounted to the Donnager-class battleship. These are able to be retracted into the utilized ships hull.</p>\n<p>A point defense cannon (PDC) is a rapid-fire projectile weapon used by all military-grade spaceships for defense against missiles and ships.</p>\n<p>PDCs are turreted rotary autocannons, utilizing a set of more, or less than, six spinning barrels to spew out thousands of rounds per minute to intercept incoming ordnance. PDCs are laid out on a ship's hull to cover all angles with overlapping fields of fire, providing a \"curtain of steel\" to more easily and effectively take out missiles. They also utilize thrusters on their rear to counteract the recoil of the firing cannon that would otherwise knock the ship off course. Some turrets can also be retracted into the hull and can extend outwards in mere seconds.</p>\n<p>PDCs are computer-controlled as even juiced-up human gunners would find it nearly impossible to effectively track and destroy fast targets like torpedoes.

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"11","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.QH86WokAXrzoo6sb"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bYogObSA2IsR6a9F","name":"Agent","type":"talent","data":{"shortDesc":"Expert","longDesc":"<p><strong>AGENT TALENT</strong></p>\n<div title=\"Page 62\">\n<p>You hide in plain sight and deal in secrets.

Measuring 250,000 tons dry weight, pound-for-pound Donnager-class battleships are one of the largest and most capable warships ever made.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Specifications</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">As the primary mainstay battleship classification in the MCRN (Martian Congressional Republic Navy), the Donnager-class serves multiple roles throughout the Sol System. At the time of the UN-MCR War, nine Donnager-class vessels existed in the Sol System before the Attack on the Donnager, serving in a variety of roles including fleet command and coordination, battleship, force projection, and carrier of gunships and infantry.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Complement</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The Donnager-class is capable of hosting a crew complement of 2086 personnel, including squads of Martian Marines and their elite Force Recon units, equipped with Goliath Powered Armor. Thanks to the ship's interior hangar bay, located near the aft of the huge vessel, ships of this line can host their own escort ships in six interior ship berths. Each berth can hold one Corvette-class frigate or two Morrigan-class destroyers.[5] The battleship additionally hosts a number of Chariot-type Dropships, repair skiffs and - depending on deployment - executive shuttlecraft.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Armament</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The most notable elements of the Donnager-class complements are its two dorsal VX-12 \"Foehammer\" Turreted Ultra-Heavy Railguns. At the time of the class' construction, these weapons were amongst the highest-spec railguns in the Solar System and only matched by orbital weapons systems. Thanks to the foresight of MCRN engineers the Donnager-class hosts a total of four railgun hardpoints on its hull, capable of doubling the ship's railgun complement should such technological advancements allowing such an upgrade become available.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Destroyer and Corvette Docked Positions</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The Donnager-class's other main weapons are its six fore and eight aft rapid-reload missile launchers, capable of attacking vessels in front of and behind the vessel. These launchers are linked to shared magazines of high-explosive (HE), plasma, flechette, and nuclear warheads. For defense, the Donnager-class employs fifty-nine Nariman Dynamics 40mm PDCs, linked to the K-19 \"Banisher\" High-Accuracy Point Defence Targeting Computer, the most advanced target tracking system employed by the MCRN. Aside from its primary armaments, the Donnager-class serves as a capable command vessel in combat, with its ranging lasers and tactical systems to help guide and coordinate the efforts of fleet elements against hostile ships. In the event that a Donnager-class battleship is boarded by hostiles, they are equipped with a 'Condition Zero' fail-safe protocol, which will scuttle the ship, ensuring the ship cannot fall into enemy hands.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in;

A ship&rsquo;s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from &ndash;2 to 6 or more, from the most minimal and broken-down sensor equipment to state-of-the-art systems found primarily in military ships. A Sensors score above 6 is extraordinary, found only in a one-of-a-kind or cutting-edge vessel.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 122\">\n<p>A ship always has at least passive sensors running, plus a mix of radar and ladar scanning the nearby regions of space, software-defined radio packages running broad spectrum sweeps for communications traffic, and automated optical tracking systems parsing data from the ship&rsquo;s telescopes. Passive sensors can be set to trigger alerts whenever they return a particular result, or when they detect predefined profiles such as those matching ship classes recorded in the onboard database or a specific ship transponder signal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div title=\"Page 123\">\n<p>When the crew decides something is of particular interest, they can use active sensors, which employ the same equip- ment but focus the area analyzed and increase the power&mdash;also making it easier to detect the ship as it sends out radar and laser emissions.

Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs.

While Captain Reyes doesn&rsquo;t like to be bothered with petty disputes or disciplinary matters, Mitchell has no problem being all up in the crew&rsquo;s business when he needs to be. And sometimes even when he doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s a bit of a bully, but he keeps things running efficiently so the captain overlooks anything that isn&rsquo;t going to cause trouble for her. Rumor has it Mitchell worked for a security corp until he stepped over the line and got canned.</p>\n<p>Mitchell grew up on Eros, where he went from wayward youth to carrying a badge after he joined Protogen&rsquo;s security force on the station. Mitchell, however, was less interested in law-and-order and more interested in belonging to what he saw as the toughest gang with the biggest opportunity for collecting bribes.</p>\n<p>Eventually, his reputation for corruption became too much even for Protogen to overlook and Mitchell was let go. With more than his share of enemies on Eros he needed to leave the station behind, and signing on with Krystal Kleer was the best opportunity. Ironically, having to leave Eros spared Mitchell from sharing the fate of the more than a million people on the station when Protogen used it as a test- bed for the protomolecule. Along with the rest of the system, he watched his old home transform and then fly off to crash into Venus.</p>\n<p>Long before that, however, Mitchell made himself at home with Krystal Kleer. His security training and his domineering personality made him good at bossing people around and getting things done, so he was promoted, eventually working his way up to XO of the Abzu&rsquo;s Bounty. Captain Reyes knows full well that Mitchell is a bully, but he also handles a lot of things and, so long as he does, she&rsquo;s willing to accommodate his &ldquo;management style.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Keenly aware of all of the newscasts and speculation about the proto- molecule, and with a few old connections with both Protogen (before it was dismantled and thrown to the wolves) and the black market in the Belt, Mitchell is still looking out for number one. He doesn&rsquo;t understand much about the protomolecule other than that it&rsquo;s the most valuable thing in the entire solar system&mdash;and his opportunity to cash in.</p>\n</div>","age":"","background":"","socialClass":"","ancestry":"Belter","profession":"","drive":{"name":"","quality":"","downfall":""},"speed":{"base":10,"mod":0,"total":10},"defense":{"base":10,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0,"total":10},"armor":{"toughness":{"total":0,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0},"impact":0,"ballistic":0,"penalty":0},"resources":{"base":6,"mod":0},"gp":0,"sp":0,"cp":0,"currency":0,"goals":"","fear":0,"horror":{"level":0,"effect":""},"aim":{"value":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"defend":{"defenseBonus":2,"active":false,"mod":0},"guardUp":{"defenseBonus":1,"testPenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"allOutAttack":{"dmgBonus":1,"defensePenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"initiativeMod":0,"abilities":{"acc":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"comm":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cons":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"dex":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"fight":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"int":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"per":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"str":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"will":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"magic":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false}},"health":{"min":0,"value":15,"set":15},"powerPoints":{"min":0,"value":10,"set":10},"fatigue":{"min":0,"entered":0,"max":4},"conviction":{"min":0,"value":3,"set":3},"advTestThreshold":0,"conditions":{"blinded":false,"deafened":false,"exhausted":false,"fatigued":false,"freefalling":false,"helpless":false,"hindred":false,"prone":false,"restrained":false,"injured":false,"wounded":false,"unconscious":false,"dying":false}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_8alizk682ar"}},"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/NPCs/pilot1.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Bart Mitchell","displayName":30,"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/NPCs/pilot1.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":20,"brightSight":100,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"uyRX73BLgYCboY0F","actorLink":true,"disposition":0,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"health"},"bar2":{"attribute":"defense.total"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"CAquEmqwOVqzBoWc","name":"Pistols","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 35\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Proficiency with single-grip, short-barrel ballistic weapons.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","useAbl":"acc","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"improved":false,"initialValue":2},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.PcPVOnwotmrvumuJ"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/gift-of-knowledge.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"ldv5GGSoXqpfXY42","name":"Stamina","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"8","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ZT73bonWt6UfLl6E"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"VyvpmokwDJjvBbFA","name":"Unarmed","type":"weapon","data":{"useAbl":"fight","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"dmgType":"wound","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":1,"diceType":"3","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","minStr":"0","useFocus":"Brawling","weight":0,"cost":"0","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"","itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}},"reload":"noAction","capacity":null,"range":2,"rangeMax":null,"rof":"none"},"sort":800000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.zdODwYMaR981I6aa"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/fist.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"tcSUDILiWLgTX1Ov","name":"Improvisation","type":"talent","data":{"shortDesc":"Novice","longDesc":"<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;
