She has also had some friction with co-workers. About two months before she disappeared, she mentioned to one of her co-workers that she had received an interesting job offer for a lot more money.

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"11","quantity":1,"equiped":true,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.QH86WokAXrzoo6sb"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"44f1N4dcjb8OeCbh","name":"KeyCard - Facility","type":"equipment","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"","weight":0,"cost":"0","quantity":1,"equiped":true,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":400001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.rbL4BvkVGs9PALAF"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"ELbRWGacHut1wXAh","name":"Biology","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica;\">Knowledge of an organized field of study and the ability to understand things related to it.

Alex was the pilot chosen to fly the Knight, the ship&rsquo;s shuttle, over to investigate the Scopuli and its distress signal.

She&rsquo;s on track to be as close as one can get to comfortable retirement out in the Belt in about ten years, and has no desire to do anything to mess that up. Captain Reyes is well known as a &ldquo;by the book&rdquo; commanding officer who doesn&rsquo;t like surprises, so it&rsquo;s no wonder she seems tense concerning this unusual development on an otherwise routine run.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Xin Reyes had dreams once, hopes of striking it big with some mining opportunity out in the Belt. Like a lot of rock-hopper pilots, her dreams ended in considerable debt and the loss of her ship when the loan company repossessed it. She also lost touch with her crew, feeling she had failed them.</p>\n<p>Still, her skills made her a useful hire for a company like Krystal Kleer,<br />and for more than a decade and a half Reyes has settled into the routine<br />of working an ice-hauler, eventually working her way up to XO and then to<br />captain of a ship again. Even if it isn&rsquo;t her ship, per se. These days Reyes<br />is focused on the much smaller dream of keeping her job and her position<br />and eventually earning enough to retire and live out the rest of her life in relative peace, but even that seems unlikely now.</p>\n<p>Xin Reyes is a middle-aged woman of primarily Chinese and Latin heritage. What she lacks in height she makes up for in no-nonsense presence. Aboard the Abzu&rsquo;s Bounty, she&rsquo;s known for being all-business and getting the job done. She&rsquo;s fair, but also isn&rsquo;t the kind to fraternize with the crew overly much.

Over two meters tall and an athletic and muscular 100 kilos, Draper served in the Martian Marine Corps for some eighteen years before she and her platoon of Marines were assigned to Ganymede following the Eros incident. Monitoring UN troop movement and patrolling the surface greenhouse domes, Draper&rsquo;s platoon encountered a jamming signal and a group of UN Marines rushing their position. Initially assuming an attack, Draper quickly realized the UN troops were instead fleeing from something that turned out to be a protomolecule hybrid. The creature wiped out both the UN and Martian soldiers, and nearly finished Bobbie before it exploded, leaving her the sole survivor.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Draper later attended a meeting between Martian and UN officials on Earth to discuss the Ganymede incident, where she blurted out the existence of the protomolecule &ldquo;monster&rdquo; that attacked her platoon. Admonished by her superiors, Draper ended up meeting Chrisjen Avasarala while drinking in a bar. Avasarala offered her a job as liaison with the Martian military, which she later accepted. This decision likely saved Avasarala&rsquo;s life when Bobbie accompanied her on board Jules-Pierre Mao&rsquo;s yacht, the Guanshiyin, serving as the undersecretary&rsquo;s escort and using her military training&mdash;and Martian Goliath-Mk.III power armor&mdash;to seize control of the ship.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","age":"","background":"","socialClass":"","ancestry":"Martian","profession":"","drive":{"name":"","quality":"","downfall":""},"speed":{"base":10,"mod":0,"total":10},"defense":{"base":10,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0,"total":10},"armor":{"toughness":{"total":0,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":1},"impact":0,"ballistic":0,"penalty":0},"resources":{"base":4,"mod":0},"gp":0,"sp":0,"cp":0,"currency":0,"goals":"","fear":0,"horror":{"level":0,"effect":""},"aim":{"value":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"defend":{"defenseBonus":2,"active":false,"mod":0},"guardUp":{"defenseBonus":1,"testPenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"allOutAttack":{"dmgBonus":1,"defensePenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"initiativeMod":2,"abilities":{"acc":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"comm":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cons":{"value":4,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"dex":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"fight":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"int":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"per":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"str":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"will":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"magic":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false}},"health":{"min":0,"value":32,"set":32},"powerPoints":{"min":0,"value":10,"set":10},"fatigue":{"min":0,"entered":0,"max":4},"conviction":{"min":0,"value":3,"set":3},"advTestThreshold":0,"conditions":{"blinded":false,"deafened":false,"exhausted":false,"fatigued":false,"freefalling":false,"helpless":false,"hindred":false,"prone":false,"restrained":false,"injured":false,"wounded":false,"unconscious":false,"dying":false}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_pim9hqk46kh"}},"img":"worlds/fortunes_favor/tokens/NPC/Bobbie%20Draper.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Bobbie Draper","displayName":50,"img":"tokens/Expanse-sdk5ne/Exports%20Hi/F_Armored_Soldier_Stand%20copy.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":20,"brightSight":100,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"YSxwlENOAy3tt4BF","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"health"},"bar2":{"attribute":"defense.total"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"UWeRJLM8pZiOqjmf","name":"Unarmed (Striking Style)","type":"weapon","data":{"useAbl":"fight","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"dmgType":"wound","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":1,"diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","minStr":"0","useFocus":"Brawling","weight":0,"cost":"0","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"","itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}},"reload":"noAction","capacity":null,"range":2,"rangeMax":null,"rof":"none"},"sort":700000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.2ZNhDqXBDiZQwzV1"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/fist.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"auG9aubBd4xV16cU","name":"UNTech 9mm","type":"weapon","data":{"useAbl":"acc","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"dmgType":"wound","dmgSource":"ballistic","nrDice":2,"diceType":"6","extraValue":1,"dmgAbl":"per","minStr":"0","useFocus":"Pistols","weight":0,"cost":"11","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<p>UNMC Service service pistol.

Two and a half meters tall and weighing 400 kilograms even before a soldier climbs inside, power armor provides both a formidable offense and defense. Half armor and half spacesuit, the armor has radiation shielding sufficient to let soldiers walk through a nuclear bomb crater minutes after the blast. The armor&rsquo;s titanium and ceramic-composite exterior shielding is typically painted with camouflage patterns appropriate to the assignment, and enemies are often surprised just how well an enormous soldier in power armor can blend into the environment when they stand still.</p>\n<p>The armor&rsquo;s hydraulics system magnifies the wearer&rsquo;s strength, much like a mech rig, and carries most of the weight of the suit, allowing soldiers in power armor to undertake marathon hikes and move surprisingly fast. They also enable the armor to carry heavy weaponry, typically a rotary machine gun and sometimes a grenade launcher or micro-missile pack. Sensor packages feed data to the wearer on the helmet&rsquo;s HUD, allowing them to identify and track infrared targeting lasers used by opponents&rsquo; weapons, and even visually parse those weapons using the suit&rsquo;s camera feeds to match them against an internal database. Those same cameras monitor in all directions, sending feeds back to squad officers and their mili- tary command center, which can monitor the life signs of both the<br />soldiers and opponents who have been detected and attacked.</p>\n<p>Despite all these capabilities, power armor is still designed for maneuverability in tight spaces, enabling infantry to move in microgravity and storm their way through the narrow confines of ships. Less so is a newer addition to the Martian arsenal: 4-meter tall, 9-ton combat mechs, walking tanks carrying rail guns and missiles adapted from ship weapon systems.

Clever and technically gifted, she taught herself a great deal from downloads and online access to information, eventually earning two advanced degrees and demonstrating a real talent with coding and programming.</p>\n<p>That same talent made Naomi valuable to certain factions of the Outer Planets Alliance, in particular a charismatic young leader named Marco Inaros. He and Naomi became romantically involved, and she became increasingly involved with Inaros&rsquo; politics. Eventually, the two of them had a son, Filip. Around that same time, Inaros used some of Naomi&rsquo;s programming work to sabotage and destroy the transport ship Augustin Gamarra out of Ceres. When Naomi learned the truth, she fell into a deep depression. Eventually, she left Inaros, who attempted to control&nbsp;her by taking custody of their infant son. Feeling she had no other choice, Naomi left them both behind.</p>\n<p>She eventually found her way to working as an engineer on board the Cantebury for the Pur&rsquo;n&rsquo;Kleen Water Company, where she was part of the crew sent to investigate the Scopuli. Although Naomi was attracted to fellow crew member and executive officer Jim Holden, she rejected Hold- en&rsquo;s initial advances due to their situation following the destruction of the Cantebury. Eventually, the two of them started a romantic relationship.</p>\n<p>Naomi is the executive officer of the Rocinante and resident technical expert, although Amos handles the engine room and most repair work. She&rsquo;s Jim Holden&rsquo;s sounding board and does what she can to curb some of his impulses with sound reason, while at the same time understanding that she can&rsquo;t change him, even if it would make her feel better knowing he was safer.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","age":"","background":"","socialClass":"","ancestry":"Belter","profession":"","drive":{"name":"","quality":"","downfall":""},"speed":{"base":10,"mod":0,"total":10},"defense":{"base":10,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":1,"total":10},"armor":{"toughness":{"total":0,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0},"impact":0,"ballistic":0,"penalty":0},"resources":{"base":4,"mod":0},"gp":0,"sp":0,"cp":0,"currency":0,"goals":"","fear":0,"horror":{"level":0,"effect":""},"aim":{"value":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"defend":{"defenseBonus":2,"active":false,"mod":0},"guardUp":{"defenseBonus":1,"testPenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"allOutAttack":{"dmgBonus":1,"defensePenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"initiativeMod":0,"abilities":{"acc":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"comm":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cons":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"dex":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"fight":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"int":{"value":4,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"per":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"str":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"will":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"magic":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false}},"health":{"min":0,"value":27,"set":27},"powerPoints":{"min":0,"value":10,"set":10},"fatigue":{"min":0,"entered":0,"max":4},"conviction":{"min":0,"value":3,"set":3},"advTestThreshold":0,"conditions":{"blinded":false,"deafened":false,"exhausted":false,"fatigued":false,"freefalling":false,"helpless":false,"hindred":false,"prone":false,"restrained":false,"injured":false,"wounded":false,"unconscious":false,"dying":false}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_pim9hqk46kh"}},"img":"worlds/fortunes_favor/tokens/NPC/Naomi%20Nagata.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Naomi Nagata","displayName":50,"img":"tokens/Expanse-sdk5ne/Exports%20Hi/F_Naomi_stand%20copy.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":20,"brightSight":100,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"del1kTHP9KDTYYos","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"health"},"bar2":{"attribute":"defense.total"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"H2UeViJ988WvXrkc","name":"Pistols","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 35\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Proficiency with single-grip, short-barrel ballistic weapons.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","useAbl":"acc","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"improved":false,"initialValue":2},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.PcPVOnwotmrvumuJ"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/gift-of-knowledge.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"fIWl5p91VdCADE5Q","name":"Deception","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"11","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.QH86WokAXrzoo6sb"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"5cY4cElzGLcF0crH","name":"Unarmed","type":"weapon","data":{"useAbl":"fight","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"dmgType":"wound","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":1,"diceType":"3","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","minStr":"0","useFocus":"Brawling","weight":0,"cost":"0","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"","itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}},"reload":"noAction","capacity":null,"range":2,"rangeMax":null,"rof":"none"},"sort":500000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.zdODwYMaR981I6aa"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/fist.svg","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}

Chrisjen Avasarala, UN Deputy Undersecretary of Executive Administration, is one of the latter, and you had better not fucking forget it. Avasarala is a long-time player in Earth politics, having served as the Treasurer of the Workers Provident Fund and district governor of the Maharashtra-Karnataka-Goa Communal Interest Zone prior to her work at the UN. She knows everyone, and anyone with sense in government circles knows her and her true level of influence.</p>\n<p>It would be easy to mistake a tiny Indian woman in her seventies, with long gray hair and dressed in a colorful traditional sari, as a kindly grandmother, and that&rsquo;s just as Avasarala prefers it. Much of the time, she&rsquo;s happy to sit in the back- ground of meetings, quietly snacking on pistachios from her handbag, while she absorbs information and plans out the next moves of the UN government. It&rsquo;s far easier to do with people focusing on popular figureheads and not paying any attention to the real levers of power. When questioned, she has been known to swear like a career Marine. That said, Avasarala is also a kind grandmother. Her daughter Ashanti has two children, Kiki and Suri, whom she dotes upon. Chrisjen is married to a poet named Arjun, and his kind nature helps to soothe her, a rare opportunity to lower the mask she must wear in dealing with people professionally. The two of them also had a son named Charanpal, who died in a skiing accident as a teenager.

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"11","quantity":1,"equiped":true,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.QH86WokAXrzoo6sb"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"ELbRWGacHut1wXAh","name":"Biology","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica;\">Knowledge of an organized field of study and the ability to understand things related to it.

That&rsquo;s where Amos Burton was a crime boss, running a number of illegal operations in the city&rsquo;s underworld. Those included unlicensed prostitution, which resulted in the equally unlicensed birth of a boy named Timmy, who was himself turned out as a prostitute as a child. Later, when Timmy was a physically strong teenager, he was recruited into Burton&rsquo;s syndicate by his childhood friend Erich, who worked for the organization as a hacker. Faced with the choice of killing his friend in order to prove himself, Timmy met with Burton empty-handed and killed the crime boss instead.</p>\n<p>Erich stole Amos Burton&rsquo;s identity and gave it to Timmy, along with a coveted apprenticeship on Luna and a ticket off of Earth, both to offer his thanks and at least partially to ensure that his friend would leave Baltimore for good. Adopting &ldquo;Amos Burton&rdquo; as his new name, the young man left Earth and all he knew behind. Amos learned to be a ship mechanic, and served on at least a couple other ships before finding himself on the Cantebury, working for Pur&rsquo;n&rsquo;Kleen. Always a survivor, Amos later became the chief engineer and mechanic on board the newly named Rocinante.</p>\n<p>Having experienced considerable trauma in his early years, Amos is capable of swift and savage violence without remorse as well as remarkable empathy and kindness. He&rsquo;s fiercely, even violently, protective of the people he cares about and intensely pragmatic towards everyone else, with his own sense of justice and the need for the strong to protect the weak.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","age":"","background":"","socialClass":"","ancestry":"Earther","profession":"Technician","drive":{"name":"","quality":"","downfall":""},"speed":{"base":10,"mod":0,"total":10},"defense":{"base":10,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0,"total":10},"armor":{"toughness":{"total":0,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":1},"impact":0,"ballistic":0,"penalty":0},"resources":{"base":4,"mod":0},"gp":0,"sp":0,"cp":0,"currency":0,"goals":"","fear":0,"horror":{"level":0,"effect":""},"aim":{"value":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"defend":{"defenseBonus":2,"active":false,"mod":0},"guardUp":{"defenseBonus":1,"testPenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"allOutAttack":{"dmgBonus":1,"defensePenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"initiativeMod":0,"abilities":{"acc":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"comm":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cons":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"dex":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"fight":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"int":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"per":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"str":{"value":3,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"will":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"magic":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false}},"health":{"min":0,"value":32,"set":32},"powerPoints":{"min":0,"value":10,"set":10},"fatigue":{"min":0,"entered":0,"max":4},"conviction":{"min":0,"value":3,"set":3},"advTestThreshold":0,"conditions":{"blinded":false,"deafened":false,"exhausted":false,"fatigued":false,"freefalling":false,"helpless":false,"hindred":false,"prone":false,"restrained":false,"injured":false,"wounded":false,"unconscious":false,"dying":false}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_pim9hqk46kh"}},"img":"worlds/fortunes_favor/tokens/NPC/Amos%20Burton.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Amos Burton","displayName":50,"img":"tokens/Expanse-sdk5ne/Exports%20Hi/M_Amos_Stand%20copy.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":20,"brightSight":100,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"oz7UbeK2GiXFiIPA","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"health"},"bar2":{"attribute":"defense.total"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"nM7fAcvtWmSTIhe2","name":"Pistols","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 35\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Proficiency with single-grip, short-barrel ballistic weapons.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","useAbl":"acc","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"improved":false,"initialValue":2},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.PcPVOnwotmrvumuJ"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/gift-of-knowledge.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"nQ1kPvP21nW4OS15","name":"Rifles","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<p>Proficiency with double-grip, long-barrel ballistic weapons.</p>","useAbl":"acc","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"improved":false,"initialValue":2},"sort":400000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.pCJfHzbs7pcRko2N"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/gift-of-knowledge.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"U1exs8HmuBOdjo1F","name":"Stamina","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;

While Captain Reyes doesn&rsquo;t like to be bothered with petty disputes or disciplinary matters, Mitchell has no problem being all up in the crew&rsquo;s business when he needs to be. And sometimes even when he doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s a bit of a bully, but he keeps things running efficiently so the captain overlooks anything that isn&rsquo;t going to cause trouble for her. Rumor has it Mitchell worked for a security corp until he stepped over the line and got canned.</p>\n<p>Mitchell grew up on Eros, where he went from wayward youth to carrying a badge after he joined Protogen&rsquo;s security force on the station. Mitchell, however, was less interested in law-and-order and more interested in belonging to what he saw as the toughest gang with the biggest opportunity for collecting bribes.</p>\n<p>Eventually, his reputation for corruption became too much even for Protogen to overlook and Mitchell was let go. With more than his share of enemies on Eros he needed to leave the station behind, and signing on with Krystal Kleer was the best opportunity. Ironically, having to leave Eros spared Mitchell from sharing the fate of the more than a million people on the station when Protogen used it as a test- bed for the protomolecule. Along with the rest of the system, he watched his old home transform and then fly off to crash into Venus.</p>\n<p>Long before that, however, Mitchell made himself at home with Krystal Kleer. His security training and his domineering personality made him good at bossing people around and getting things done, so he was promoted, eventually working his way up to XO of the Abzu&rsquo;s Bounty. Captain Reyes knows full well that Mitchell is a bully, but he also handles a lot of things and, so long as he does, she&rsquo;s willing to accommodate his &ldquo;management style.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Keenly aware of all of the newscasts and speculation about the proto- molecule, and with a few old connections with both Protogen (before it was dismantled and thrown to the wolves) and the black market in the Belt, Mitchell is still looking out for number one. He doesn&rsquo;t understand much about the protomolecule other than that it&rsquo;s the most valuable thing in the entire solar system&mdash;and his opportunity to cash in.</p>\n</div>","age":"","background":"","socialClass":"","ancestry":"Belter","profession":"","drive":{"name":"","quality":"","downfall":""},"speed":{"base":10,"mod":0,"total":10},"defense":{"base":10,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0,"total":10},"armor":{"toughness":{"total":0,"mod":0,"gameModeBonus":0},"impact":0,"ballistic":0,"penalty":0},"resources":{"base":6,"mod":0},"gp":0,"sp":0,"cp":0,"currency":0,"goals":"","fear":0,"horror":{"level":0,"effect":""},"aim":{"value":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"defend":{"defenseBonus":2,"active":false,"mod":0},"guardUp":{"defenseBonus":1,"testPenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"allOutAttack":{"dmgBonus":1,"defensePenalty":1,"active":false,"mod":0},"initiativeMod":0,"abilities":{"acc":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"comm":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cons":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"dex":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"fight":{"value":1,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"int":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"per":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"str":{"value":2,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"will":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"magic":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"primary":false,"lastUp":false}},"health":{"min":0,"value":15,"set":15},"powerPoints":{"min":0,"value":10,"set":10},"fatigue":{"min":0,"entered":0,"max":4},"conviction":{"min":0,"value":3,"set":3},"advTestThreshold":0,"conditions":{"blinded":false,"deafened":false,"exhausted":false,"fatigued":false,"freefalling":false,"helpless":false,"hindred":false,"prone":false,"restrained":false,"injured":false,"wounded":false,"unconscious":false,"dying":false}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_8alizk682ar"}},"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/NPCs/pilot1.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Bart Mitchell","displayName":30,"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/NPCs/pilot1.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":20,"brightSight":100,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"uyRX73BLgYCboY0F","actorLink":true,"disposition":0,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"health"},"bar2":{"attribute":"defense.total"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"CAquEmqwOVqzBoWc","name":"Pistols","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 35\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Proficiency with single-grip, short-barrel ballistic weapons.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","useAbl":"acc","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"improved":false,"initialValue":2},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.PcPVOnwotmrvumuJ"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/gift-of-knowledge.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"ldv5GGSoXqpfXY42","name":"Stamina","type":"focus","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"11","quantity":1,"equiped":true,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.QH86WokAXrzoo6sb"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"2LOhBEzAs9quQpep","name":"KeyCard - Facility","type":"equipment","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"","weight":0,"cost":"0","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":400001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.rbL4BvkVGs9PALAF"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"z7099HiY2zllC5E8","name":"Oratory","type":"talent","data":{"shortDesc":"Expert","longDesc":"<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\"><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong>: Communication (Persuasion) focus</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\">You are a skilled public speaker who can sway others with your words.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s2\" style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 11.5px; line-height: normal; font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\"><strong>NOVICE</strong>: </span><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\">You know how to work a crowd.

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"8","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ZT73bonWt6UfLl6E"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"8AhAZhmGb4p3shk6","name":"Grappling Style","type":"talent","data":{"shortDesc":"Novice","longDesc":"<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\"><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong>: Fighting (Grappling) focus</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\">You&rsquo;re skilled in restraining and subduing opponents in unarmed combat.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s2\" style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 11.5px; line-height: normal; font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\"><strong>NOVICE</strong>: </span><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\">If you fail an opposed Fighting (Grappling) test to avoid being grappled, as per the Grapple stunt&rsquo;s description in Chapter 5, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s2\" style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 11.5px; line-height: normal; font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\"><strong>EXPERT</strong>: </span><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-kerning: none; background-color: #ffffff;\">If you successfully hit an opponent with an unarmed attack and choose a stunt from the Grappling category, you gain 1 additional SP to apply.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;\"><span class=\"s3\" style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 11.5px; line-height: normal; font-kerning: none;\"><strong>MASTER</strong>: </span><span class=\"s4\" style=\"font-kerning: none;\">You can perform the Pin stunt for 3 SP instead of the usual 4.

Hand terminals are cheap and ubiquitously available, and when one is lost or damaged it is easily replaced and the user&rsquo;s profile reloaded from backup on a partition.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 69\">\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":"8","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ZT73bonWt6UfLl6E"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/briefcase.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"VyvpmokwDJjvBbFA","name":"Unarmed","type":"weapon","data":{"useAbl":"fight","targetNumber":10,"powerPointCost":1,"fatigueTN":10,"dmgType":"wound","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":1,"diceType":"3","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","minStr":"0","useFocus":"Brawling","weight":0,"cost":"0","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"","itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}},"reload":"noAction","capacity":null,"range":2,"rangeMax":null,"rof":"none"},"sort":800000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.zdODwYMaR981I6aa"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/fist.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"tcSUDILiWLgTX1Ov","name":"Improvisation","type":"talent","data":{"shortDesc":"Novice","longDesc":"<p class=\"p1\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;
