Missiles are the standard primary armament on all warships.</p>\n<p>They are also referred to as \"torpedoes\" when used in ship-to-ship combat, or \"nukes\" when equipped with a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p>Missiles are long-range, guided missile delivery systems that can be fitted with conventional explosives, plasma warheads (which melt armor and damage systems), flechette warheads (which penetrate ship armor better than an HE warhead, but not as well as a plasma warhead, and don more widespead systemic damage) or varying-yield nuclear warheads. They are jettisoned from the launcher, align themselves with the target, and then begin accelerating to high speed. They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range. This is countered by firing them in numbers to overwhelm the PDCs on an enemy ship.</p>\n<p>As is seen with the Canterbury's destruction, missiles can have the side-effect of turning the \"splashed\" ship into a destructive field of moving debris, posing a further threat to any other ship in the immediate area. For this reason, the use of missiles in CQB is avoided.</p>\n<p>Being the standard armament on combat vessels, even ships small enough to not be fitted with rail guns can carry missiles. Frigates, corvettes, and patrol boats have one or two firing tubes. Larger ships like cruisers, battleships, and dreadnoughts carry between 3 and 10 tubes.</p>\n<p>Torpedoes follow the direction of shipboard targeting lasers used to &ldquo;paint&rdquo; an enemy, switching over to their own internal guidance systems when necessary. A primary function of point defense cannons is to shoot down incoming torpedoes before they can reach the ship, with electronic warfare countermeasures looking to confuse and throw off their guidance systems so a capable pilot can evade them.</p>\n<p>The ship must be at least Medium-sized to mount a single torpedo launcher.

However, much of this advantage is lost.</p>\n<p>Despite its small size, the Leonidas-class suffers from poor acceleration resulting from its low-quality S-250 series Epstein drives, units considered outdated even before ships of this class entered service. Low-quality targeting suites also affect the efficiency of its torpedoes and point defense cannons (PDCs) negatively, requiring more to be added to increase effective point defense and torpedo impact probability in a sort of \"spray'n'pray\" mentality.

Famed for its sturdiness, and reliability, it is one of the longest-serving vessels in the history of the UNN, having protected Earth's interests across the system for decades.</p>\n<p>The Truman-class dreadnought is armed with 2 Farren-Pattern high-yield heavy railgun turrets, each armed with a pair of adjustable Farren-Pattern high-yield heavy railguns that are able to inflict lethal damage over vast distances and are some of the most powerful and accurate weapons systems available to the UNN. Matched only by the highly advanced MCRN railguns and the UNN Orbital Railgun Platforms, the Truman's railguns are able to strike a target almost instantaneously when fired from within 1000 kilometers, launching an unguided tungsten projectile that will effortlessly perforate the full mass of the targeted craft, tearing through multiple decks and often striking a critical subsystem to neutralize the target vessel in a single shot. These weapons are supported by 42 Redfield Ballistics 40 mm Point Defense Cannons (PDC), spread across the surface of the dreadnought for maximum defensive coverage, as well as 9 autoloading torpedo bays compatible with a variety of warheads. The effective targeting range of the Truman-class is shorter than that of most MCRN warships but its extensive PDC grid enables it to endure even the largest torpedo volleys, protecting the ship from harm while coordinating fleet movements or bringing her railguns to bear. Unlike the style of Martian warships, the PDCs of the Truman-class dreadnoughts don't seem to be retractable in the vessel's hull itself. This would make its PDCs have more reaction time in some situations, however it does put its PDCs at risk of impact damage.</p>\n<p>A pair of hangar bays and accompanying external docking clamps are located in the midsection of the Truman-class, where its complement of 6 L-Type UNN dropship skiffs, as well as a smaller number of short-range repair skiffs and reconnaissance drones are housed. Though the Truman-class is not quite large enough to carry corvettes in its internal hangars like the MCRN Donnager-class battleships, its embarked dropships widen its mission profile to include Marine deployment and surface reconnaissance.</p>\n<p>The class shows its age in several ways, such as naked pipes and wires above corridors and constant electrical issues. The circular CIC of the class is however perhaps the most notable example of the ships age, as it makes use of computers operated with keyboards, switches and sticks rather than touchscreens and holographic interfaces as seen aboard MCRN ships and other more modern ships. However, many may have been upgraded to include touchscreen and holographic interfaces as such with the UNN Thomas Prince.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one of its most valuable traits, its versatility, an attribute that has stood the test of time, surely is the \"crown jewel\" of the ship. Few vessels are able to serve as both a battleship and a troop transport without sacrificing effectiveness in both areas, but the streamlined design of the Truman-class allows the vessel to carry out missions that would otherwise require a small flotilla. This high level of adaptability has earned the Truman-class its impressive reputation, and serves as an enduring reminder that technological sophistication is often no substitute for a simple and reliable design.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>\n<p>The Truman-class dreadnought contains many various facilities within for a warship this size.

Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs.

Accompanying his crew was Doctor Michael Iturbi, a scientist and confidante of Assistant Undersecretary Chrisjen Avasarala Books.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving at Venus, they found that Mars had also dispatched a ship to study the Eros Crater. The Martian Congressional Republic Navy ship was broadcasting a warning to all ships nearby to avoid them. The Arboghast attempted to get detailed scans with its complement of six probes on board. The first four probes disappeared before they were able to transmit any telemetry. The crew then tried again by lowering their altitude and launching their fifth probe, which was loaded with extra protective plating cannibalized from the sixth to help it survive the descent. Although this one was successful in its attempts at reaching the crater, it only broadcast video and telemetry of protomolecule structures for a few moments before dying.</p>\n<p>Knowing that the crater was active, Janus and Iturbi discussed what to do and decided to descend the ship into Venus's atmosphere to get a closer look. The crew prepared for the descent and deployed the ship's ballutes for atmospheric entry. Their sensors started to malfunction mid-descent before spotting that the crater itself appeared to be moving. The Martian vessel, which had been observing the Arboghast's efforts, followed the UN ship into the atmosphere, descending faster and passing very close to the Arboghast. However, it disappeared from sensors soon after.</p>\n<p>Next, the Arboghast came to an abrupt stop in mid-air, not yet having reached the surface.

It was protecting the UNN freighter Amberjack on a UN-MCR supply route when it was attacked by pirates. The Tynan knocked out the pirate ship and captured one of its crew in a vac suit.</p>\n<p>This ship assisted in the boarding of Marco Inaros's personal ship by firing PDC rounds at its drive cone, before a breaching pod attached to the ship. Ashford led the boarding party to capture Inaros, but they were all killed in the attack.</p>\n<p>After killing Ashford and his entire crew, Inaros had his people strip the Tynan of all its vital components including PDCs, fuel pellets, hull armor, computer panels, data cores, and comms buffers. The ship was then abandoned despite being a good hull as a message to other Belters not to defy him.</p>\n<p>After breaking off from the Outer Planets Alliance and becoming a pirate, Camina Drummer and her crews found the stripped Tynan adrift in space. Drummer had her crew fix the hull breaches and restore the ship to operational condition. Whilst this left a strain on their resources, it was successful, and the Tynan joined her small fleet, growing it to three ships. Racks of missiles were installed onto the ship in place of the missing PDCs. Camina later found Ashford's hidden stash in the airlock including a recording of him talking to Marco Inaros moments before his death.</p>\n<p>The Tynan sports MCRN markings on its hull as well as several PDC placements. It appears that the ship was not MCRN-built, but that Ashford obtained PDCs and sections of Martian hull armor and had them installed onto his ship.</p>\n<p>The ship contained 2✕ PDC until its stripping down by Marco Inaros. After Drummer obtained the ship, she had the missing PDCs replaced with missiles.</p>\n<p>The PDCs were stolen from the Martian Congressional Republic Navy with Drummer stating that they were the best in the Belt.</p>\n<p>After Drummer had the Tynan restored and refitted, its display panels still showed its original configuration with extra armor and PDC emplacements despite these having been stripped previously.</p>","passengers":[],"crew":{"min":1,"current":16,"typical":1,"competence":"1"},"weapons":{},"systems":{"maneuver":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"dex","useFocus":""},"command":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"comm","useFocus":""},"sensors":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"int","useFocus":""},"damageControl":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","TN":11,"useAbl":"int","useFocus":"","threshold":{"current":0,"target":5}}},"losses":{"normal":{"collateral":{"actual":0,"max":6},"hull":{"actual":0,"max":6},"maneuverability":{"actual":0,"max":6},"sensors":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weapons":{"actual":0,"max":6}},"serious":{"reactorOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weaponOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6}}},"takenOut":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/expanse-pack/item-assets/ships/Tynan.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tynan","displayName":50,"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/Expanse_Ships/Tynan-36m-token.png","tint":"","width":4,"height":4,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"c5HrVUtqSBClfPxs","actorLink":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"5pyrROq68OgIyICm","name":"Torpedo Tube - Light","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>Configurable Light-Grade Torpedo Launcher</strong></p>\n<p>Able to launch light grade torpedos (4d6 Conventional HE or 3d6&nbsp;Plasma or Flechette)</p>\n<p>A missile is a powerful self-propelled weapon with an explosive warhead designed to detonate either on contact with its target or in proximity to it. Missiles are the standard primary armament on all warships.</p>\n<p>They are also referred to as \"torpedoes\" when used in ship-to-ship combat, or \"nukes\" when equipped with a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p>Missiles are long-range, guided missile delivery systems that can be fitted with conventional explosives, plasma warheads (which melt armor and damage systems), flechette warheads (which penetrate ship armor better than an HE warhead, but not as well as a plasma warhead, and don more widespead systemic damage) or varying-yield nuclear warheads. They are jettisoned from the launcher, align themselves with the target, and then begin accelerating to high speed. They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range. This is countered by firing them in numbers to overwhelm the PDCs on an enemy ship.</p>\n<p>As is seen with the Canterbury's destruction, missiles can have the side-effect of turning the \"splashed\" ship into a destructive field of moving debris, posing a further threat to any other ship in the immediate area. For this reason, the use of missiles in CQB is avoided.</p>\n<p>Being the standard armament on combat vessels, even ships small enough to not be fitted with rail guns can carry missiles. Frigates, corvettes, and patrol boats have one or two firing tubes. Larger ships like cruisers, battleships, and dreadnoughts carry between 3 and 10 tubes.</p>\n<p>Torpedoes follow the direction of shipboard targeting lasers used to &ldquo;paint&rdquo; an enemy, switching over to their own internal guidance systems when necessary. A primary function of point defense cannons is to shoot down incoming torpedoes before they can reach the ship, with electronic warfare countermeasures looking to confuse and throw off their guidance systems so a capable pilot can evade them.</p>\n<p>The ship must be at least Medium-sized to mount a single torpedo launcher.

While requiring the ship to turn and aim the cannon, these gave a comparatively small warship a massive amount of firepower.</p>\n<p>A railgun is a powerful ship-to-ship weapon used by the United Nations Navy, the Martian Congressional Republic Navy, the Outer Planets Alliance, and Protogen Corporation for space combat</p>\n<p>Railguns are large, powerful mass drivers, cannons that use electroconductive rails and the Lorentz Effect to accelerate a dense metal slug at very high speeds, relying on mass and sheer speed to punch clean through ships rather than warheads like with torpedoes. These weapons require significant power (typically supplied by a fusion power-plant) to fire and must charge briefly before firing. They range from light, fast firing railguns with small calibers (presumably around 40 millimeters) to ultra-heavy types, firing heavier slugs on a lower rate of fire.</p>\n<p>Railguns are typically spinal weapons that require the ship to turn and face the target to aim the weapon. This is the case with Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigate, the Rocinante after her upgrade and UNN Railgun Platforms. Larger ships, however, can carry turreted railguns. The MCRN's Donnager-class battleships and UNN's Leonidas-class battleships and Truman-class dreadnought carry pairs of railgun turrets, allowing them to more easily engage targets without having to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p>Railgun shots are powerful and accurate high-energy kinetic penetrators, operating in the kiloton or even megaton range, capable of shooting clean through even large ships and doing critical damage, depending on their caliber and point of impact. Super-heavy railguns, mounted on battleships, are able to obliterate smaller ships with a single hit, as shown by the MCRN Donnager against an Amun-Ra frigate. Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs. However, in those cases, if the round does not hit any critical components, it will simply perforate the ship being attacked, leaving small holes that can be plugged relatively easily, such as when Naomi Nagata sealed a hole aboard the Donnager with an instruction manual and specialized adhesive.</p>\n<p>Though powerful and with technically almost unlimited range in space because of Newtons first law, railguns are limited in their effective range against targets in motion. Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p>Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"3d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.2ck7xl3Qlpm4v0Hz"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bhFNtIklaUSgVLnB","name":"PDC - Bush Shipyards Hypercooled","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>Bush Shipyards Hypercooled Point Defense Cannons</strong></p>\n<p>PDC turrets specifically designed by the Bush shipyards for Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates.

Missiles are the standard primary armament on all warships.</p>\n<p>They are also referred to as \"torpedoes\" when used in ship-to-ship combat, or \"nukes\" when equipped with a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p>Missiles are long-range, guided missile delivery systems that can be fitted with conventional explosives, plasma warheads (which melt armor and damage systems), flechette warheads (which penetrate ship armor better than an HE warhead, but not as well as a plasma warhead, and don more widespead systemic damage) or varying-yield nuclear warheads. They are jettisoned from the launcher, align themselves with the target, and then begin accelerating to high speed. They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range. This is countered by firing them in numbers to overwhelm the PDCs on an enemy ship.</p>\n<p>As is seen with the Canterbury's destruction, missiles can have the side-effect of turning the \"splashed\" ship into a destructive field of moving debris, posing a further threat to any other ship in the immediate area. For this reason, the use of missiles in CQB is avoided.</p>\n<p>Being the standard armament on combat vessels, even ships small enough to not be fitted with rail guns can carry missiles. Frigates, corvettes, and patrol boats have one or two firing tubes.

Missiles are the standard primary armament on all warships.</p>\n<p>They are also referred to as \"torpedoes\" when used in ship-to-ship combat, or \"nukes\" when equipped with a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p>Missiles are long-range, guided missile delivery systems that can be fitted with conventional explosives, plasma warheads (which melt armor and damage systems), flechette warheads (which penetrate ship armor better than an HE warhead, but not as well as a plasma warhead, and don more widespead systemic damage) or varying-yield nuclear warheads. They are jettisoned from the launcher, align themselves with the target, and then begin accelerating to high speed. They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement.

The ship&rsquo;s computer assembles this data into usable information for the crew, fed to their terminals. A ship&rsquo;s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from &ndash;2 to 6 or more, from the most minimal and broken-down sensor equipment to state-of-the-art systems found primarily in military ships. A Sensors score above 6 is extraordinary, found only in a one-of-a-kind or cutting-edge vessel.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 122\">\n<p>A ship always has at least passive sensors running, plus a mix of radar and ladar scanning the nearby regions of space, software-defined radio packages running broad spectrum sweeps for communications traffic, and automated optical tracking systems parsing data from the ship&rsquo;s telescopes. Passive sensors can be set to trigger alerts whenever they return a particular result, or when they detect predefined profiles such as those matching ship classes recorded in the onboard database or a specific ship transponder signal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div title=\"Page 123\">\n<p>When the crew decides something is of particular interest, they can use active sensors, which employ the same equip- ment but focus the area analyzed and increase the power&mdash;also making it easier to detect the ship as it sends out radar and laser emissions. Aboard military vessels, the operations and battle stations are linked by expert systems making up a broad- spectrum intelligence package combing all sets of incoming data in real-time, filtering it, and helping the ship&rsquo;s crew focus on priority targets.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When sensors detect trouble, a ship&rsquo;s crew will usually ready whatever weapons systems they have available, using the sensors to target them, but most ships also have defensive countermeasures packages used to help keep enemies from targeting them. Communications arrays can broadcast cycling bursts of radio static across commonly used frequencies to jam communications, and at close enough range, communications lasers can be used to try and blind enemy targeting optics.

A ship&rsquo;s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from &ndash;2 to 6 or more, from the most minimal and broken-down sensor equipment to state-of-the-art systems found primarily in military ships. A Sensors score above 6 is extraordinary, found only in a one-of-a-kind or cutting-edge vessel.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 122\">\n<p>A ship always has at least passive sensors running, plus a mix of radar and ladar scanning the nearby regions of space, software-defined radio packages running broad spectrum sweeps for communications traffic, and automated optical tracking systems parsing data from the ship&rsquo;s telescopes. Passive sensors can be set to trigger alerts whenever they return a particular result, or when they detect predefined profiles such as those matching ship classes recorded in the onboard database or a specific ship transponder signal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div title=\"Page 123\">\n<p>When the crew decides something is of particular interest, they can use active sensors, which employ the same equip- ment but focus the area analyzed and increase the power&mdash;also making it easier to detect the ship as it sends out radar and laser emissions. Aboard military vessels, the operations and battle stations are linked by expert systems making up a broad- spectrum intelligence package combing all sets of incoming data in real-time, filtering it, and helping the ship&rsquo;s crew focus on priority targets.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When sensors detect trouble, a ship&rsquo;s crew will usually ready whatever weapons systems they have available, using the sensors to target them, but most ships also have defensive countermeasures packages used to help keep enemies from targeting them. Communications arrays can broadcast cycling bursts of radio static across commonly used frequencies to jam communications, and at close enough range, communications lasers can be used to try and blind enemy targeting optics.

These weapons require significant power (typically supplied by a fusion power-plant) to fire and must charge briefly before firing. They range from light, fast firing railguns with small calibers (presumably around 40 millimeters) to ultra-heavy types, firing heavier slugs on a lower rate of fire.</p>\n<p>Railguns are typically spinal weapons that require the ship to turn and face the target to aim the weapon. This is the case with Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigate, the Rocinante after her upgrade and UNN Railgun Platforms. Larger ships, however, can carry turreted railguns. The MCRN's Donnager-class battleships and UNN's Leonidas-class battleships and Truman-class dreadnought carry pairs of railgun turrets, allowing them to more easily engage targets without having to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p>Railgun shots are powerful and accurate high-energy kinetic penetrators, operating in the kiloton or even megaton range, capable of shooting clean through even large ships and doing critical damage, depending on their caliber and point of impact. Super-heavy railguns, mounted on battleships, are able to obliterate smaller ships with a single hit, as shown by the MCRN Donnager against an Amun-Ra frigate. Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs. However, in those cases, if the round does not hit any critical components, it will simply perforate the ship being attacked, leaving small holes that can be plugged relatively easily, such as when Naomi Nagata sealed a hole aboard the Donnager with an instruction manual and specialized adhesive.</p>\n<p>Though powerful and with technically almost unlimited range in space because of Newtons first law, railguns are limited in their effective range against targets in motion. Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p>Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"3d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.2ck7xl3Qlpm4v0Hz"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bhFNtIklaUSgVLnB","name":"PDC - Bush Shipyards Hypercooled","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>Bush Shipyards Hypercooled Point Defense Cannons</strong></p>\n<p>PDC turrets specifically designed by the Bush shipyards for Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates.

Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p>Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"3d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.2ck7xl3Qlpm4v0Hz"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bhFNtIklaUSgVLnB","name":"PDC - Bush Shipyards Hypercooled","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>Bush Shipyards Hypercooled Point Defense Cannons</strong></p>\n<p>PDC turrets specifically designed by the Bush shipyards for Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates.

A ship&rsquo;s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from &ndash;2 to 6 or more, from the most minimal and broken-down sensor equipment to state-of-the-art systems found primarily in military ships.

Physical chaff can be ejected into space between the ship and enemies, spreading out clutter to interfere with targeting lasers or radar.</p>\n<p>ADVANCED SENSOR PACKAGE (Core Rules, pg 122)</p>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 124\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The ship&rsquo;s sensor package and associated software are upgraded, providing a +1 increase in Sensors score for each time this quality is applied.
