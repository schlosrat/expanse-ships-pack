While requiring the ship to turn and aim the cannon, these gave a comparatively small warship a massive amount of firepower.</p>\n<p>A railgun is a powerful ship-to-ship weapon used by the United Nations Navy, the Martian Congressional Republic Navy, the Outer Planets Alliance, and Protogen Corporation for space combat</p>\n<p>Railguns are large, powerful mass drivers, cannons that use electroconductive rails and the Lorentz Effect to accelerate a dense metal slug at very high speeds, relying on mass and sheer speed to punch clean through ships rather than warheads like with torpedoes. These weapons require significant power (typically supplied by a fusion power-plant) to fire and must charge briefly before firing. They range from light, fast firing railguns with small calibers (presumably around 40 millimeters) to ultra-heavy types, firing heavier slugs on a lower rate of fire.</p>\n<p>Railguns are typically spinal weapons that require the ship to turn and face the target to aim the weapon. This is the case with Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigate, the Rocinante after her upgrade and UNN Railgun Platforms. Larger ships, however, can carry turreted railguns. The MCRN's Donnager-class battleships and UNN's Leonidas-class battleships and Truman-class dreadnought carry pairs of railgun turrets, allowing them to more easily engage targets without having to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p>Railgun shots are powerful and accurate high-energy kinetic penetrators, operating in the kiloton or even megaton range, capable of shooting clean through even large ships and doing critical damage, depending on their caliber and point of impact. Super-heavy railguns, mounted on battleships, are able to obliterate smaller ships with a single hit, as shown by the MCRN Donnager against an Amun-Ra frigate. Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs. However, in those cases, if the round does not hit any critical components, it will simply perforate the ship being attacked, leaving small holes that can be plugged relatively easily, such as when Naomi Nagata sealed a hole aboard the Donnager with an instruction manual and specialized adhesive.</p>\n<p>Though powerful and with technically almost unlimited range in space because of Newtons first law, railguns are limited in their effective range against targets in motion. Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p>Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"3d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.2ck7xl3Qlpm4v0Hz"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bhFNtIklaUSgVLnB","name":"PDC - Bush Shipyards Hypercooled","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>Bush Shipyards Hypercooled Point Defense Cannons</strong></p>\n<p>PDC turrets specifically designed by the Bush shipyards for Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates.

A ship&rsquo;s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from &ndash;2 to 6 or more, from the most minimal and broken-down sensor equipment to state-of-the-art systems found primarily in military ships.

A ship&rsquo;s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from &ndash;2 to 6 or more, from the most minimal and broken-down sensor equipment to state-of-the-art systems found primarily in military ships.

PDCs are laid out on a ship's hull to cover all angles with overlapping fields of fire, providing a \"curtain of steel\" to more easily and effectively take out missiles.

Some turrets can also be retracted into the hull and can extend outwards in mere seconds.</p>\n<p>PDCs are computer-controlled as even juiced-up human gunners would find it nearly impossible to effectively track and destroy fast targets like torpedoes.

Missiles are the standard primary armament on all warships.</p>\n<p>They are also referred to as \"torpedoes\" when used in ship-to-ship combat, or \"nukes\" when equipped with a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p>Missiles are long-range, guided missile delivery systems that can be fitted with conventional explosives, plasma warheads (which melt armor and damage systems), flechette warheads (which penetrate ship armor better than an HE warhead, but not as well as a plasma warhead, and don more widespead systemic damage) or varying-yield nuclear warheads. They are jettisoned from the launcher, align themselves with the target, and then begin accelerating to high speed. They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range.

These weapons require significant power (typically supplied by a fusion power-plant) to fire and must charge briefly before firing. They range from light, fast firing railguns with small calibers (presumably around 40 millimeters) to ultra-heavy types, firing heavier slugs on a lower rate of fire.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-variant-caps: small-caps; background-color: #ffffff;\">Railguns are typically spinal weapons that require the ship to turn and face the target to aim the weapon. This is the case with Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigate, the Rocinante after her upgrade and UNN Railgun Platforms. Larger ships, however, can carry turreted railguns. The MCRN's Donnager-class battleships and UNN's Leonidas-class battleships and Truman-class dreadnought carry pairs of railgun turrets, allowing them to more easily engage targets without having to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-variant-caps: small-caps; background-color: #ffffff;\">Railgun shots are powerful and accurate high-energy kinetic penetrators, operating in the kiloton or even megaton range, capable of shooting clean through even large ships and doing critical damage, depending on their caliber and point of impact. Super-heavy railguns, mounted on battleships, are able to obliterate smaller ships with a single hit, as shown by the MCRN Donnager against an Amun-Ra frigate. Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs. However, in those cases, if the round does not hit any critical components, it will simply perforate the ship being attacked, leaving small holes that can be plugged relatively easily, such as when Naomi Nagata sealed a hole aboard the Donnager with an instruction manual and specialized adhesive.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-variant-caps: small-caps; background-color: #ffffff;\">Though powerful and with technically almost unlimited range in space because of Newtons first law, railguns are limited in their effective range against targets in motion. Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-variant-caps: small-caps; background-color: #ffffff;\">Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"6d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Nkcy4PIkXqdHcO1R"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"FrlDzN3J12hL9S7T","name":"Rail Gun - VX-12 Foehammer","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>VX-12 'Foehammer' Ultra-Heavy Railgun</strong></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-variant-caps: small-caps; background-color: #ffffff;\">An entirely new railgun design purpose-built for the Martian Congressional Republic Navy's Donnager-class Battleships, the VX-12 Foehammer boasts the longest range and greatest firepower of any ship-mounted railgun ever constructed.

They range from light, fast firing railguns with small calibers (presumably around 40 millimeters) to ultra-heavy types, firing heavier slugs on a lower rate of fire.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-variant-caps: small-caps; background-color: #ffffff;\">Railguns are typically spinal weapons that require the ship to turn and face the target to aim the weapon. This is the case with Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigate, the Rocinante after her upgrade and UNN Railgun Platforms. Larger ships, however, can carry turreted railguns. The MCRN's Donnager-class battleships and UNN's Leonidas-class battleships and Truman-class dreadnought carry pairs of railgun turrets, allowing them to more easily engage targets without having to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-variant-caps: small-caps; background-color: #ffffff;\">Railgun shots are powerful and accurate high-energy kinetic penetrators, operating in the kiloton or even megaton range, capable of shooting clean through even large ships and doing critical damage, depending on their caliber and point of impact. Super-heavy railguns, mounted on battleships, are able to obliterate smaller ships with a single hit, as shown by the MCRN Donnager against an Amun-Ra frigate. Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs. However, in those cases, if the round does not hit any critical components, it will simply perforate the ship being attacked, leaving small holes that can be plugged relatively easily, such as when Naomi Nagata sealed a hole aboard the Donnager with an instruction manual and specialized adhesive.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-variant-caps: small-caps; background-color: #ffffff;\">Though powerful and with technically almost unlimited range in space because of Newtons first law, railguns are limited in their effective range against targets in motion. Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-variant-caps: small-caps; background-color: #ffffff;\">Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"6d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Nkcy4PIkXqdHcO1R"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"jaKZgQoIWcfhDcZy","name":"PDC Bank 1 - 10 x Nariman Dynamics 40mm","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>Nariman Dynamics Rapid Targeting 40mm K-19 Banisher Point Defense Cannons</strong></p>\n<p>A type of PDC manufactured by Nariman Dynamics that is used by most MCRN warships.

Missiles are the standard primary armament on all warships.</p>\n<p>They are also referred to as \"torpedoes\" when used in ship-to-ship combat, or \"nukes\" when equipped with a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p>Missiles are long-range, guided missile delivery systems that can be fitted with conventional explosives, plasma warheads (which melt armor and damage systems), flechette warheads (which penetrate ship armor better than an HE warhead, but not as well as a plasma warhead, and don more widespead systemic damage) or varying-yield nuclear warheads. They are jettisoned from the launcher, align themselves with the target, and then begin accelerating to high speed. They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range. This is countered by firing them in numbers to overwhelm the PDCs on an enemy ship.</p>\n<p>As is seen with the Canterbury's destruction, missiles can have the side-effect of turning the \"splashed\" ship into a destructive field of moving debris, posing a further threat to any other ship in the immediate area.

These weapons require significant power (typically supplied by a fusion power-plant) to fire and must charge briefly before firing. They range from light, fast firing railguns with small calibers (presumably around 40 millimeters) to ultra-heavy types, firing heavier slugs on a lower rate of fire.</p>\n<p>Railguns are typically spinal weapons that require the ship to turn and face the target to aim the weapon. This is the case with Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigate, the Rocinante after her upgrade and UNN Railgun Platforms. Larger ships, however, can carry turreted railguns. The MCRN's Donnager-class battleships and UNN's Leonidas-class battleships and Truman-class dreadnought carry pairs of railgun turrets, allowing them to more easily engage targets without having to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p>Railgun shots are powerful and accurate high-energy kinetic penetrators, operating in the kiloton or even megaton range, capable of shooting clean through even large ships and doing critical damage, depending on their caliber and point of impact. Super-heavy railguns, mounted on battleships, are able to obliterate smaller ships with a single hit, as shown by the MCRN Donnager against an Amun-Ra frigate. Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs. However, in those cases, if the round does not hit any critical components, it will simply perforate the ship being attacked, leaving small holes that can be plugged relatively easily, such as when Naomi Nagata sealed a hole aboard the Donnager with an instruction manual and specialized adhesive.</p>\n<p>Though powerful and with technically almost unlimited range in space because of Newtons first law, railguns are limited in their effective range against targets in motion. Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p>Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"3d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.2ck7xl3Qlpm4v0Hz"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bhFNtIklaUSgVLnB","name":"PDC - Bush Shipyards Hypercooled","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>Bush Shipyards Hypercooled Point Defense Cannons</strong></p>\n<p>PDC turrets specifically designed by the Bush shipyards for Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates.

A ship&rsquo;s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from &ndash;2 to 6 or more, from the most minimal and broken-down sensor equipment to state-of-the-art systems found primarily in military ships.
